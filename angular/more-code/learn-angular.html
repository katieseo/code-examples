    <h2>Angularâ€™s $apply() and $digest()</h2>

    {{aModel}}

    $scope.$watch('aModel', function(newValue, oldValue) {
      //update the DOM with newValue
    });

    * AngularJS offers Data binding which change something in the view, the scope model automagically updates.
    Similarly, whenever the scope model changes, the view updates itself with the new value.
    How does does AngularJS do that? 

    1. (ng-Click, ng-model, $timeout, etc (built-in directives/services that let you change models) function 
       > change a scope model, automatically trigger a $digest cycle.
        
    2. Angular calls $scope.$apply() > it calls $rootScope.$digest()
       > As a result of this, a digest cycle starts at the $rootScope, and subsequently visits all the child scopes calling the watchers along the way.
    3. AngularJS automatically triggers $scope.$digest()
    4. $digest cycle starts
    5. $digest cycle fires each of the watchers
    6. These watchers check if the current value of the scope model is different from last calculated value
        and If yes, then the corresponding listener function executes.
    7. As a result if you have any expressions in the view they will be updated.


    ** When Do You Call $apply() Manually to triggers a $digest cycle

        - when use Javascript's setTimeout() >>> use $timeout service

            <div ng-app="myApp">
              <div ng-controller="MessageController">
                Delayed Message: {{message}}
              </div>  
            </div>

            <script>
                // $scope.$apply() automatically triggers $rootScope.$digest()

                angular.module('myApp',[]).controller('MessageController', function($scope) {
        
                  $scope.getMessage = function() {
                    setTimeout(function() {
                      $scope.$apply(function() {
                        //wrapped this within $apply
                        $scope.message = 'Fetched after 3 seconds'; 
                        console.log('message:' + $scope.message);
                      });
                    }, 2000);
                  }
                  
                  $scope.getMessage();
                
                });
            </script>

            <script>
                // can place a call to $apply() (the no-arg version) in the end

                $scope.getMessage = function() {
                  setTimeout(function() {
                    $scope.message = 'Fetched after two seconds';
                    console.log('message:' + $scope.message);
                    $scope.$apply(); //this triggers a $digest
                  }, 2000);
                };
            </script>

    <h2>factory, services</h2>
    
    // Use service if you want to create a single object: 
    // it gets called as a constructor so you just assign any methods to this
    // and everything will share the same object.
    // Result: When declaring serviceName as an injectable argument you will be provided with the instance of a function passed to module.service.
    // Usage: Could be useful for sharing utility functions that are useful to invoke by simply appending () to the injected function reference. Could also be run with injectedArg.call( this ) or similar.


    // Use factory if you want full control over whether or not an object is created 
    // though it is still only called once.
    // Result: When declaring factoryName as an injectable argument you will be provided the value that is returned by invoking the function reference passed to module.factory.
    //Usage: Could be useful for returning a 'class' function that can then be new'ed to create instances.


   // Factory use a factory function which return a service instance. serviceInstance = fnFactory();

    //Service use a constructor function and Angular invoke this constructor function using 'new' keyword for creating the service instance. serviceInstance = new fnServiceConstructor();

    // Use value to return a simple value,

    // use const for values you can use within config.
